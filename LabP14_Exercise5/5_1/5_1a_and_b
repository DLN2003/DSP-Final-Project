% To design our bandpass filters we have to
% find the frequency range for each octave
% This code imports the table of octaves
% from excel so the data can easily be used
% in the next section.


% Fs = 8000
% omega = f*2pi/Fs
BP_Filters = readtable("Bandpass_Filters.xlsx"); % Load Bandpass filters from file
BP_Filters(8:11,:) = []; % Removes unnecessary rows
